The problem case this project aims to target is the unvailaibility of  proper mode of communication between us and the deaf and dumb due to lack of knowledge of sign-language among common people. This model effectively converts the sign gestures into text and then to speech to aid us in understanding what the disabled person wishes to say. From a consumerâ€™s end, he will only have to carry a small portable physical device which will have a camera, display, a speaker and a network card(through which it will communicate with the main system). This device will record the gestures and transmit the corresponding message in the form of text and speech. Along with it the device will also have a pre-stored photos and videos to help us communicate using signs with the deaf. The device will carry out the activities by accessing  the main system using cloud services.
